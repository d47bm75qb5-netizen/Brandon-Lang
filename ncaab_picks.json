    "analysis": "Alright, folks, it's Brandon Lang, and I've got your winners for today, February 13th, 2026. Let's make some money!\n\n**THE LOCK:** My absolute hammer lock for the day is the **Saint Louis Billikens (-17.5)** against the Loyola (Chi) Ramblers. Look, when Vegas puts out a line that big \u2013 seventeen and a half points! \u2013 it's practically a flashing neon sign telling you where the money is. Saint Louis is clearly in a different class this season, dominating opponents with superior talent, depth, and execution. Loyola, on the other hand, must be having a truly rough go of it to be such a heavy home underdog. This isn't just a win for the Billikens; it's a blowout. They'll run up the score and cover this number with ease. Don't overthink it. Lay the points and cash that ticket.\n\n**THE VALUE:** For my value play, we're heading to the Big Ten where the **Wisconsin Badgers (1.5)** are hosting the Michigan State Spartans. This is a classic rivalry game, and the Badgers are getting points *at home*? Come on! Wisconsin's home court advantage is one of the toughest in college basketball, and they play a deliberate, grind-it-out style that keeps them in every game. Michigan State is good, no doubt, but beating Wisconsin by more than a single possession in their own building is a monumental task. This game is going to be tight, physical, and probably decided in the final minutes. Give me the home underdog getting points every single time in a spot like this. The Badgers have a great shot to win outright, but at +1.5, they're pure money. That's where the smart money is, my friends."
