    "analysis": "Alright, listen up, degenerates! It's Friday, January 31st, 2026, and Brandon Lang is here to make you some money on the college hoops slate. The books are trying to tempt you with some big numbers, but we're going to sniff out the real plays.\n\nFor my **LOCK** of the day, I'm rolling with the **Xavier Musketeers (-4.5)** against those perennial punching bags, the DePaul Blue Demons. Seriously, how long has DePaul been the basement dweller of the Big East? It feels like an eternity. Xavier might not be setting the world on fire every night, but they're a legitimate Big East program, especially at home in the Cintas Center. DePaul consistently struggles to compete, especially on the road. Laying less than five points here against a team that's practically a guaranteed fade? That's a gift from the gods of gambling. Xavier covers this spread comfortably, no sweat.\n\nNow, for my **VALUE** play, we're looking at the **San Diego St Aztecs (7.5)** on the road against the Utah State Aggies. Everyone knows SDSU. They're built on defense, discipline, and making every possession a battle. They don't blow teams out often, but more importantly, they RARELY get blown out. Utah State is tough at home, I'll give you that, but asking them to beat a veteran, tournament-caliber Aztecs squad by more than 7 points is a big ask. SDSU thrives in tight games, grinds out possessions, and has the defensive chops to slow down any offense. Getting 7.5 points with a team that knows how to stay in every game? That's golden. I'm taking the Aztecs to keep this one close, if not pull off an upset outright. Cash that ticket!"
