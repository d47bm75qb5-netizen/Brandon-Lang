    "analysis": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get down to business. It's February 17th, 2026, and the college hoops slate has a couple of gems if you know where to look. Brandon Lang is here to make you some money.\n\nFirst, for the **LOCK** of the day: We're heading out West to the land of high altitude and even higher scores. I'm backing the **New Mexico Lobos (-27.5)** against the Air Force Falcons. Now, a 27.5-point spread? That's not a misprint, folks; that's the house screaming at you. When a line is that massive in college basketball, it's not a suggestion; it's a proclamation. New Mexico at home, in The Pit, is a different beast entirely. They play fast, they score in bunches, and they suffocate lesser opponents. Air Force is historically one of the Mountain West's bottom feeders, and going into a hostile environment like Albuquerque against a Lobos team that smells blood in the water is a recipe for disaster. The books don't hand out these numbers lightly; this is going to be an absolute blowout. Lay the points, cash the ticket.\n\nNow, for the **VALUE** play, where we sniff out the disrespect and capitalize. I'm looking right at the Big Ten, taking the **Purdue Boilermakers (2.5)** at home against the Michigan Wolverines. Let me tell you, there are few places tougher to play in college basketball than Mackey Arena. To see Purdue, a perennial Big Ten powerhouse and often a top-10 team, getting 2.5 points on their home court against a Michigan squad that's been more inconsistent than a Vegas slot machine, that's a gift from the betting gods. The oddsmakers might be banking on some recency bias or a slight overvaluation of Michigan, but Purdue at home, getting points, in a conference rivalry game? They're going to come out fired up, physical, and ready to prove a point. They'll keep this one tight, likely win it outright, but we'll gladly take the cushion. That's pure value right there. Don't overthink it, fade the public perception and back the Boilermakers."
