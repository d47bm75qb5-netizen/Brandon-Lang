    "analysis": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and find some winners on this Monday slate, folks. Brandon Lang here, and I've got a couple of plays that scream 'money in the bank' for us.\n\nFirst up, my **LOCK** of the day is the **Drake Bulldogs (-3.0)** laying only three points at home against Valparaiso. Are you kidding me? Drake is a consistent powerhouse in the Missouri Valley Conference, especially when they're playing in their own gym. They're typically one of the most efficient teams, solid on both ends of the floor, and they know how to finish games. Valparaiso, bless their hearts, usually finds themselves near the bottom of the league. A -3.0 spread for Drake at home against an inferior conference opponent is practically a gift from the oddsmakers. Drake should handle this with ease, winning by at least a touchdown, if not more. This line is just too soft for a team of Drake's caliber at home.\n\nFor my **VALUE** play, I'm looking straight at the **Xavier Musketeers (15.0)** as a 15-point underdog against St. John's. Now, I know what you're thinking \u2013 15 points in the Big East? But hear me out. While St. John's might be having a stellar season, or Xavier might be struggling more than usual, a 15-point spread in a power conference game is massive. Big East teams, even when one is 'down' and the other is 'up,' rarely get absolutely steamrolled by that margin. Xavier has a pedigree, talent on the roster, and pride. They might not win this game outright, but the chances of St. John's covering a 15-point spread against a Big East rival are slim. Xavier will find a way to keep this one closer than the books are predicting. That's a huge cushion for an underdog with some fight in them."
