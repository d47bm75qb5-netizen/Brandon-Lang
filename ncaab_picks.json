    "analysis": "Alright, listen up, because Brandon Lang is about to drop some truth bombs on these books. Today, we're feasting on their sloppy lines. My LOCK OF THE DAY is the **Fairleigh Dickinson Knights -1.5 (-115) on BetMGM**. Are you KIDDING ME? Other books have these Knights at -375 to -580 on the moneyline, and BetMGM gifts us a paltry -1.5 spread? That's not a line, that's a donation. Someone at BetMGM needs to go back to school, because this is pure larceny. FDU rolls, and we cash this ticket easily. For my VALUE PLAY, give me the **Le Moyne Dolphins +14.5 (100) on DraftKings**. LIU is favored, sure, but 14.5 points is a chasm in college hoops. Getting even money for a team to lose by less than 15? That's just smart money recognizing the inflated hype. The public is all in on the blowout, but Lang sees the real play. Le Moyne covers, and the squares cry. You're welcome."
