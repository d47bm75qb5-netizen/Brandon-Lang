    "analysis": "Alright, it's Brandon Lang, and we're digging into the college hoops board for February 11th. We're looking for the mismatches and the undervalued dogs, because that's where the money's made. Let's get to it. \n\n**THE LOCK: UNC Greensboro Spartans (-8.5) vs. VMI Keydets**\nThis is a no-brainer, folks. UNCG is a consistently tough, defensive-minded squad, especially when they're playing on their home court. They know how to shut teams down and grind out wins. On the flip side, VMI is often one of the weaker teams in the SoCon, and they struggle significantly on the road. They're prone to blowouts against disciplined teams like UNCG. Laying -8.5 points at home against a team that's consistently near the bottom of the barrel? That's a gift. UNCG covers this with room to spare. Cash it.\n\n**THE VALUE: Furman Paladins (2.5) @ Mercer Bears**\nNow for the value, we're looking at the SoCon again. Furman, historically, is a team that always finds a way to compete, even when they're not at their absolute peak. They've got a strong program identity and they don't roll over for anybody. Mercer as a -2.5 favorite at home? That line tells me the books are giving too much respect to Mercer's home court and not enough to Furman's tenacity. Getting +2.5 points here, I love the Paladins to keep this game tight, if not win it outright. This is a classic spot for a tough underdog to cover and make us some money. Take the points with Furman."
