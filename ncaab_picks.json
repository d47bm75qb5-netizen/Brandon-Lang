    "analysis": "Alright, the calendar flips to February 19th, 2026, and I've got my eyes on these NCAA hardwood battles. The books are trying to be slick, but Lang sees right through it.\n\n**My LOCK of the day?** We're riding with the **Charleston Cougars (-5.0)** as they roll into North Carolina A&T. Look, Charleston is a legitimate mid-major powerhouse, a team built for March runs, year in and year out. They've got the talent, the coaching, and the relentless offensive attack that puts lesser teams away. North Carolina A&T? They're often scrapping at the bottom of the barrel in their conference. A 5-point spread for a team like Charleston against an inferior opponent? That's not a line, folks, that's a discount. The Cougars aren't just winning this game; they're covering it comfortably and sending a message. This is about as close to free money as you'll find on a Thursday. Bet it, cash it, thank me later.\n\n**Now for some serious VALUE,** we're taking the **Marshall Thundering Herd (3.5)** against Appalachian State. This is a classic Sun Belt clash, and the oddsmakers are giving us a gift with Marshall catching 3.5 points. The Herd, when they're clicking, are an offensive machine \u2013 they can light up the scoreboard faster than a Vegas neon sign. App State is tough at home, no doubt, but they've got vulnerabilities, especially against teams that can push the pace and hit from deep. Marshall has the firepower to keep this game tight, even on the road, and honestly, they've got a real shot at winning outright. Getting over a possession for a team with that kind of offensive upside? That's where you make your money, taking a live dog who can bite. Don't let the books fool you; Marshall keeps this one close or pulls off the upset. Lang's got the read."
